## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Server and Client Components separation
- Mock API with realistic delays (300-600ms)

### State Management
- Zustand for global state
- TanStack Query for server state
- localStorage for theme persistence

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS with custom color palette

- Screen reader support

### Color Scheme
- Primary (Indigo): Healthcare professionalism
- Secondary (Mint): Health and wellness
- Accent (Peach): Warmth and approachability
- Muted (Lavender): Calm and trust

## Mock Data
All data is simulated in `lib/api.ts`:
- 3 messages (2 unread)
- 4 AI recommendations
- 6 treatment plan tasks
- 4 appointments
- 4 lab results
- Complete Smart City dataset

## Code Quality
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Clean folder structure
- Reusable components
- Type-safe API layer
- Consistent naming conventions

## Performance
- Static page generation
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Efficient re-renders with React Query

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Responsive across all screen sizes

## Development Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint (if configured)

## Project Statistics
- 9 pages/routes
- 12+ custom components
- 100+ TypeScript types
- Full type coverage
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dark mode support

## Innovation: Smart City Integration
The Smart City module uniquely combines:
- Environmental health data (air quality, pollen)
- Urban mobility (walking routes optimized for health)
- Community engagement (health campaigns)
- Population health analytics (district-level insights)

This creates a holistic view of how urban environment affects personal health and promotes preventive care through city-level data integration.
